    "text": "Quantifying colorful communities: Community assembly, function and resilience of corals throughout South Florida using spectral traits\n\nCoral reefs are facing dire threats due to anthropogenic climate change1. From rising sea surface temperatures, increasing ocean acidity, more frequent disturbance events from hurricanes, and increased levels of nutrient and other pollution. Yet, despite the increasing frequency and severity of mass bleaching events2, informative metrics for quantifying the function, and resilience of coral communities remains limited. Innovative techniques in terrestrial communities are relying on trait-based methods to better visualize concepts such as community assembly3, species interactions4, and habitat suitability5. Thus, my dissertation will first explore novel methodology techniques to extract coral physiological traits values non-invasively via spectral reflectance. Subsequently, I will be performing an observational study applying a trait-based diversity metric to coral communities in South Florida to better explain why individuals have been able to persist across environmental gradients, how these traits are influencing population demography, and interactions with other benthic competitors such as macroalgae.\n\nCreating the Coral Health Index"

    "text": "This trip was an International Research Experience for graduate Students (IRES) funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). I took an intensive course studying transdisciplinary coral reef science. We heard from Aborigional Australian leaders, historians, coral reef scientists and social-economic scientists during our trip, explaining the value and benefit of using transdisciplinary approaches to tacking the issues of coral reefs worldwide.\nThis trip did not start out well for me, I did have a small hissy fit in the Dallas Airport at midnight because I missed my flight from Dallas to Sydney. The departing plane from Miami to Dallas was held up leaving its earlier destination, which set in motion for me a chaotic and depressing ride, because I knew at 5pm I wasn’t going to be going to Australia that evening. So, out of our cohort of 10, I was the one person that got delayed and flew into Australia a day later than everyone else. Which in the grand scheme of things is nothing, but in the moment I was very upset. Luckily, the rest of the trip went smoothly and more importantly, my flight back home went without a hitch, which was more important since I’d be going straight into a Grand Canyon Exhibition.\nMy 17 hour plane ride flew into Sydney, and then I had what felt like a quick 4 hour trip from Sydney to the Cairns airport. Because I was a day late, Tyler, our trip leader, arranged for a van to pick me up and drop me off in downtown Port Douglas, where the rest of the group would be waiting for me. I’d traveled alone many times at this point, so wasn’t scared or worried, just a little nauseous from the van ride, but I got over it. I finally met everyone in person after having plenty of online zoom meetings to prepare for the trip, and everyone was so nice and welcoming right away! It definitely helped that I already knew Emily, as she is also a PhD student at FIU, and Piper, who graduated from IU and we had mutual friends in undergrad. What a small world! But I was fortunate to have two buddies already with me in this three week endeavor.\nWe spent the first two days in the Daintree rainforest, staying at the Crocodylus eco lodge, where we listened to lectures from Aborigional leaders regarding their particiaption in modern ecological management practices in the Daintree and historians who gave us a rundown of the political influences that have altered the Daintree ecosystem. We stayed there to also get a multidisciplinary view of how the Northern Great Barrier Reef is impacted by the Daintree, and vice versa. We also took a few hikes and had lunch on Thornton Beach, which was gorgeous. The flora and fauna in the Daintree was incredible, it is the oldest continuously surviving rainforest in the world. We learned about some of the native tree species, including fan palms, strangler figs, and more. The intimate symbiotic relationships on display here was beautiful to learn about, as this ecosystem has had millennia to perfect these partnerships. After our experience in the rainforest, we drove back down to Cairns to hop on two small Piper Chieftians, that took us and all of our gear to Lizard Island! Saying one last goodbye to the mainland and the Daintree, we took off for the hour plane ride over the Great Barrier Reef. This was such a remote area of the world, I had never experienced anything like it before. It was quite a stark difference from living in Miami for the past year!\n We stayed at Lizard for a little less than two weeks. This time was absolutely magical, I could have stayed here for the rest of my life! The island has the research station where we stayed at, but also has a high-profile resort on the island as well. That was interesting, we didn’t see many of the visitors of the resort but knowing that there were essentially two separate worlds living on this tiny remote island was weird. We got off the planes, unloaded luggage and was picked up by some of the research station staff in a big John Deer tractor! I of course had a little chuckle about that, and felt right at home.\nNow, I wouldn’t say that I have roughed it too hard in my previous field accomodations, but after seeing the research and housing facilities at Lizard, I know why it’s refered to as a world class research insititute. Everything was amazing, from our little beach cabins, the boating and diving facilities, and the laboratory facilities was top notch. We hit the ground running and got an orientation walk from Tyler and a boating and diving safety lecture from Lyle, the DSO for the station. The next day, we took the boats out to our first site, Clam Gardens, which was appropriately named. Unlike our Caribbean coral reef ecosystem, the Great Barrier Reef is riddled with giant clams that become encrusted into the substrate by the fast growing and abundant Acorpora species. I think out of all of the incredible and iconic wildlife I saw here, the giant clams were my favorite. On their lips was the most spectacular blue coloration I have ever seen. While being quite the fashion statement, the blue coloration also helps direct downwelling light into the clams tissues so that their symbiont algae can photosynthesize (just like the relationship with coral). We also saw some of the most unique species of coral, including lots of Pocillopora, which was about the only genus I felt comfortable IDing.\nThroughout our time on Lizard we had a few researchers joining us and leading lectures and field excursions. My favorite of all of them was Dr. Morgan Pratchett. If you are studying coral biology/ecology, then you definitely know how much of a big shot he is in the field. Learning GBR coral species ID from him was such a treat (and I like to play the taxonomic guessing game, too, which helps) and his many lectures on coral reef ecology in the GBR were very insightful. After he left, we had some time without lectures to go out and collect our own data for our mini-project presentations. We also had some down time to explore the island, which included our day-long hike up Cooks Look, which was the most incredible view I’ve ever seen. We got to overlook the Blue Lagoon and smaller islands surrounding Lizard and see the outer reef. It was so amazing.\n\n\n\nAfter our time was up on Lizard, we headed back to Townsville, home of James Cook University, where we had some lectures with researchers who study the social-economic interactions of ecosystem-based and species-based management practices. This research was also very interesting and highlighted just how interdependent our marine ecosystem is with local and global economies, in addition to communities. James Cook was a really neat University, I am glad that we were able to visit and get a little tour. We also toured the Billabong Sanctuary, where we got to have up-close interactions with all of the iconic Australia species, like Kangaroos, Koalas, crocodiles, and wombats. We also toured the Australian Institute of Marine Science Townsville location, the insititute’s headquarters, which was absolutely incredible. They have the world class SeaSim - the National Sea Simulator. It allows for researchers to precisely control water quality parameters such as temperature, pH, and salinity to get the most impact out of laboratory experiments. They also had a large host of adaptive evolution breeding experiments going on, with a few chimeras too. As much as I loved being on Lizard Island, Townsville was also an awesome end of trip experience for all of us.\nTo round out our trip, Morgan booked us a room at a JCU building downtown where we could present our research projects, and a few of his grad students came along too to listen. It was a great little celebration and we all went out to dinner together afterwards! This trip was truly a once in a lifetime experience for me, and I am so happy that I was able to participate in this program, and espeically to see the Great Barrier Reef before it eventually succumbs to climate change. I loved Australia too, and would go back in a heartbeat to work there. I can’t say when I will be back, but I know that I will make my way down under again soon.\n\nAdditionally, I created the end of program vlog for our trip!

    "text": "Upbringing\n\n\nI was born and raised in Northern Indiana, a product of Land of Lakes County. I only half jokingly say that lake water makes up my blood. Growing up, my family and I would spend every possible moment on our boat. I have fond memories of enjoying the water: from leisurely boat rides, dropping anchor and getting lost in a book, to water skiing, wakeboarding, and surfing. I even got my PADI open water certification in the lake! Each summer before high school (before sports practices started to dominate my schedule) I would also commandeer my families paddle boat to catch turtles, jar seaweed to ID on the family computer, and look for bluegill nests along the channel edge. Being so connected to the water from an early age undoubtedly shaped my career path in the natural sciences.\n\n\n\nHobbies\n\nAs previously mentioned, I grew up as an athlete as well as an amateur limnologist, and sports are still a large part of my life today. In addition to playing three sports in high school, I also was on my collegiate wakeboarding club team, which was such as cool experience and how I met some of my best friends at university. I’m a passionate fan of men’s and women’s basketball, always rooting on my Hoosiers, and love March Madness. I don’t play a lot of basketball anymore, but do spend a lot of my free time playing tennis recreationally. It’s a lot easier to do so here in South Florida, where there’s never any snow! I also have recently been getting into running as a hobby, and completed my first half marathon in February of 2025. Looking forward to more races to come!\n\n\nOutside of school and being active, I don’t have much time for anything else, but on occasion do like to partake in some creative hobbies as well. These include reading, making friendship bracelets, which I do just for fun and gift to people I love (I joke that if I give you one, your now branded by me) and also by journaling and scrapbooking. I never throw anything away, so scrapbooking is a great way to commemorate the useless things with sentimental value I’ve collected, like concert tickets, admission bracelets, boarding passes and fliers. It’s a fun way to keep all of these things while not having them make a mess and clutter up my room.\n\n\n\nScuba Diving\n\n\nOf course, being a coral reef ecologist means that diving is a part of my job. But I still enjoy suiting up to go for recreational dives, and South Florida is a mecca for the diving industry in the US. I was first certified at 10 as a Junior Open Water Diver. I grew up watching my dad dive on our family vacations with my aunt and uncle, so I eagerly waited when I turned 10 so I could get certified too. I didn’t get my second certification until I was at Indiana University. My advisor had introduced me to the Center for Underwater Science when I mentioned I wanted to focus in marine science, and enrolled in the advanced course. From then on I was hooked in the Center, continuing up to Dive Master as well as getting my scientific diving cert at IU, and became an instructor the Summer of 2022. Teaching diving was a difficult transition for me, quite frankly I was terrified at first of having people’s lives in my hands, but realized that it is so rewarding. What made teaching so fulfilling to me was the couple of students whose eyes would light up and I knew that I’d opened a new world of possibilities for them. I don’t teach diving anymore since I’m in grad school, but I do hope to find my way back into the recreational diving world."

    "text": "Pura vida, welcome to Costa Rica! This vacation was my first one without my parents or with a club, so it was very nice to just be travelling with my partner and not have to worry about appeasing a big group. This trip was very laid-back, Ben planned most of where we were going to go and what we’d do, since I was busy with DR and Florida Field Schools for IU at the time. He kept our schedules open each day except for the day we would dive on Cano island, so that we could get to know each spot and check out what we’d wanted to do beforehand. Ben had some travel woes, which made me nervous but luckily all worked out. I was already in Miami with my parents checking out housing for the upcoming school year starting at FIU, so Ben’s plan was that he would fly from Indy to Miami the night before, stay with us at the hotel, and then we’d fly to Costa Rica the next morning. Well, due to bad rain in Indianapolis, his flight was delayed, and it was the last one out for the evening. I was stressed because I didn’t really want to wait for him alone in the airport in Costa Rica, but luckily American rebooked him the first flight the next morning so he had a long enough layover to make our scheduled flight to San Jose.\n\nDiving in the Cano Island Biological Reserve is a testament to Costa Rica’s extremely high priority of protecting natural resources. I had never seen such a high density of sharks on a dive as I did here, which is usually a sign of a healthy ecosystem with strong predator-prey dynamics.\n\nUpon arriving in the capital, we were shuttled to the rental car center and picked up the car we’d be using for our time in the country. Our first stop was driving Northwest to La Fortuna, because we wanted to explore the rain forests and Parque Nacional Volcan Arenal. Between the tiny roads winding up and down mountains and the fact that we’d skipped lunch and were extremely hangry, the drive was not that great. But we persevered and made it to our Airbnb (which I did the booking for) and it was beautiful! We had a huge room, king sized bed, and the most stunning view of Arenal Volcano from our window. Plus, a hot tub! We spent three days here where we explored various parks, hikes, and waterfalls. We did the Mystico Hanging Bridges tour, went to La Fortuna Waterfall, and the Arenal 1968 hike. We also did a guided night hike in the rainforest just on the edge of town. The biodiversity and landscape of the rainforest was breathtaking. We got the most picturesque views of the volcano, the hanging bridges, and the local fauna, including Coatis, Central American Squirrel Monkeys, Capuchin Monkeys, and lots of reptiles on our night hike. I think one of my favorite things to do was the afternoons we would drive down to El Salto, the rope swing just south of town. Tourists and locals alike were taking their turn plunging into the water below. Of course, Ben had to show off with a couple of backflips (I also encouraged him) but it was fun to hang out and meet people that way too. I also really enjoyed the Arenal 1968 trail that we hiked. It was a 2.9 mile hike that took us to the edge of where the lava flow stopped during the 1968 eruption. The views were incredible.\n\n  \n\nThe second portion of our trip we moved from the rainforest to the ocean, as we made an 8 hour drive from La Fortuna down to Uvita, making a stop along the way in Playa Hermosa for sushi and to talk to the surf shop we were going to rent boards from later in the week. We stayed for two nights in Uvita so that we could take an all-day diving excursion on Cano Island. This was also a big highlight of the trip. The Airbnb I’d booked for this portion was little more than a shack with only the necessities: a bathroom, kitchenette, table and chairs for eating, places to put luggage and a loft for sleeping. Which was my first time in this type of accommodation, but it was actually pretty fun, and I liked it a lot. We arrived and settled in, didn’t do a lot in the evening since we’d be diving in the morning and wanted to be fresh. We met at the dive shop, Blacktip Divers, in the morning, boarded the boat and took about an hour ride to our first dive site. We did about a 45 minute dive at 70 feet, which was deeper than I was expecting. I must admit that I wasn’t expecting much from these dives, I’d dove before in the Mexican Pacific, and wasn’t very impressed, as the Eastern Pacific doesn’t have the coral coverage that the Caribbean does. However, as we’d come to find out, where it might’ve been lacking in coral coverage it wasn’t lacking in megafauna presence. Cano Island is nicknamed the “Little Cocos” because of the megafauna that hangs out there. Cocos Island is also owned by Costa Rica, is a biological reserve, and is world renown for it’s ecological importance as a feeding and breeding ground for several pelagic shark species. While Cano isn’t quite as revered, it still serves the same function, and we saw more sharks on these dives (all whitetips) than I’d ever seen on all my dives combined! Which, is typically a good sign of a healthy ecosystem, since sharks rely on a high amount of fish biomass to sustain themselves, this system is functioning quite well to be able to support the high biomass of top predator species. Not to mention, we also saw quite a few, very large turtles, which is always a treat to see! Our survace interval was a stop on the island to explore a bit, which was gorgeous. Ben and I hiked a little trail up to a lookout point to get a gorgeous vista of the island and surrounding waters, and then we headed back to the boat to go out for dive #2. This dive was similar, so many sharks and turtles too, it was awesome. I was also pleasntly surprised at how warm the water is, normally I get chilly even in 80 degree water, but was comfortable the whole time during both dives. We were served a great lunch, and headed back to the mainland after our trip. It was truly an incredible time.\n\n\n\nThe last part of our trip was spent in Playa Hermosa, a small town just south of Jaco, where we spent the last 4 days of our vacation. We took our time with the two hour drive up the coast from Uvita, stopping at little waterfalls and swimming pools along the way. We also stopped at Parque Nacional Manuel Antonio and attempted to get in, but didin’t realize with the popularity of the park that we’d had to have booked a reservation about a month in advance. So, that was a bummer, but just means we have a reason to come back! We did hang out at the beach there for a while, and then made our way North again to our Airbnb. We’d had great luck all trip with our Airbnbs, but this last one gave me at least some troubles.  First, we couldn’t find the place, and the address given to us was wrong, so we waited around 20 mintues for the owner to get in contact with us and send the right address. Then, when we got there I felt a bit unsafe. (nothing happened to us, fortunately) To top things off, there was also definitely some sort of critter that was living with us that kept leaving us little poops as a surprise, so that was a bit gross, and there was a window left open in the bathroom without a screen, so I woke up to about a hundred mosquito bites from the first night sleeping there. Woes of our room aside, this part of the trip was very chill, we didn’t have anything planned other than early morning surf sessions and chilling out in the afternoons! Which felt so nice! We got surf lessons from Ariel at Hermosa Riders and he was so great! He told us about another locals spot just a 15 minute drive north from Jaco that we went to one day. It was just us and one other guy and it started to rain during our session too, which was even more vibey and cool. I got a lot better at surfing, and by the end of the trip was catching and riding waves. I can’t say the next time I’ll surf (not a lot of big waves in Miami!) but I definitely got the surfing itch after this trip.\nThe end of our trip was smooth getting back to Indiana just in time for the 4th of July weekend at the lake. Costa Rica was a dream vacation, I will definitely be back, as we really only just scratched the surface of all that there is to see and do in this beautiful country.\n\nImage Gallery:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nImages courtesy of myself and Ben Rygiel (shot on iPhone, Canon EOS in Ikelite Housing, Nikon D7500)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I was fortunate enough to participate in four research trips to the Dominican Republic as a part of the IU Center for Underwater Science. This post summarizes the efforts of all of these trips.\n\n\n As a student at IU in the Underwater Science program, I had definitely drank the cool-aid that director Charles Beeker had fed us. He sat all of the undergrads that were selected to go on the trip down at a pre-departure meeting in March of 2022 to discuss how this trip is important for the ongoing research of the Center, and basically, that this was a high-profile collaboration between US institutions and the Dominican government. And, that this experience is one of only a handful of opportunities in the country where undergrads can get scientific diving experience, diving for data collection and monitoring of 16-18th century shipwrecks. While he wasn’t wrong about the diving, I’ve had enough trips both as a student and as a faculty member under my belt after leaving IU knowing that these yearly meetings were more to pump up the students, and to keep them on their best behavior while staying at an all-inclusive (which, for college kids, means all you can drink) resort.\nDespite the Center being an underwater archaeology program, my heart always lied in the ecology of coral reefs. Additionally, I was interested in learning photogrammetry techniques that were employed in our case for shipwreck monitoring, but also are used in temporal observational studies of coral reefs. Thus, for my first trip, Dr. Beeker had assigned me to the Dendrogyra cylindrus monitoring project. Of course, I was estatic to be getting field experience, to be leading scuba diving operations as a newly certified dive master, but also to be able to employ some of the knowledge I now knew about coral biology from my internship at Mote. This first project didn’t amount to anything other than more photogrammetric modelling data for the Center and a report for the Dominican Government (unfortunately, scientific papers don’t really come out of the Center due to a lack of research guidance from professors. This is another story in and of itself, and one that I hope for the sake of future students can change) but at the time, I was just happy for the invaluable field work experience. Unfortunately during my four trips to the DR, I witnessed stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) sweep through the area and ravage coral communities. Of the 14 known mature colonies of D.cyl in just a 400 x 200m area, almost all of them succumbed to the disease. If you have a background in coral biology, then you know that this species is already very rare, so to have a density this large is almost unheard of anywhere else in the Caribbean. Thus, it makes this progression even more of a blow to the coral restoration community.\n\n \n\n\nLeft image is Dendrogyra cylindrus colony #3, “Emma’s colony” pre-SCTLD in May of 2022. Right image is in active SCTLD November of 2022.\n\nOf course, since I was one of a few bio people on the trip, my project didn’t last more than the first three days of the trip, and we were off to other archaeological sites for monitoring and rapid assessment of their condition. This includes shipwrecks off the coast of DR, but also a freshwater rinse in the cavern systems in Parque Nacional Cotubanama and in the eastern tip of the island. These dives were a highlight of my first trip, and in years afterwards, was always a favorite part of first-time students trips as well. A grad student in the anthropology department who made her way through the Underwater Science program (and taught my advanced open water course), Kirsten, is conducting her dissertation research utilizing carbon dating of pottery sherds discarded by the indigenous Taíno peoples in these caverns. These underground submerged cave and cavern systems are numerous in the Yucatan Peninsula, Greater Antilles, and Florida due to the geological history of the Caribbean. It’s theorized that the Taíno people viewed these submerged caves as a gateway to their watery underworld, in addition to being vital for providing fresh water. Thus, many sacrifices were made to cave and cavern systems all throughout Hispaniola consisting of pottery, wooden bowls and utensils, and even wooden clubs. While we did not help Kirsten with data collection of artifacts from these caverns, we were able to tour them and their extremely rich history. It was a very humbling experience to see the underwater realm that the Taíno peoples treated with such respect and gratitude. If you would like to learn more about the rich history of the Taíno people’s history and meeting with European colonizers, you can learn more on the IU Underwater Science website..\nThe main priority of these research trips shifted from my first to last trip, from monitoring existing archaeological sites to evaluation of an unidentified 16th century shipwreck off the coast of Cap Cana, we now refer to as the Punta Espada shipwreck. My good friend and anthropology PhD student at IU, Sarah’s dissertation will revolve around identifying the wreck. This has proven to be much more difficult than previously anticipated, because the wreck was looted by treasure hunters before we were allowed access to the site. Thus, while there are artifacts housed in the Museo De Las Atrazanas Reales (Royal Shipyards Naval Museum), Sarah and her team haven’t yet found a “smoking gun” artifact. We’ve attempted to collect as much information from the site as possible, including detailed measurements of the anchor of salvation and many compacted bombards on the site. Additionally, there’s been many artifacts that the Museum and the DGPCS have housed from the wreck, including nested weights with makers marks that help to show where the ship might have gotten it’s cargo from in Europe, pewter dishware, and other artifacts. Work on this project allowed me to assist with artifact restoration both in the lab at IU and in Dominican Republic using electrolysis and other cleaning tools. I also was able to dive extensively on the site, conducting a biological survey of the many healthy Acropora palmata colonies on the site and aid in a small restoration project of outplanting palmata fragments back to the site. We also took several trips to the captiol, Santo Domingo, to visit with government agencies and review other artifacts related to the wreck.\n\nCheck out this Video that Sam Arvin made from our 2022 trip:\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Gallery:\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nImages courtesy of myself (on iphone, GoPro Hero 10, 35mm film camera), Ben Rygiel, Samuel Haskell, and Bob Kessler"

    "text": "“The Grand Canyon, her majesty with walls red like a cape and glistening water she wears as jewels helped me to remember to honor the earth as the royalty she is and helped remind me why I do what I do.”\n\n\nThis Trip was nothing short of amazing. It was a back-to-back travel experience for me, as I landed in the Las Vegas airport at midnight, after 24 hours of travel from Townsville, Australia. I met my mom in the hotel lobby, of course she stayed up to greet me, and we stayed up a lot longer than we should have discussing my trip.\n\nIn the whirlwind of travelling and feeling like I’d somehow manifested to Las Vegas, I wasn’t exactly looking forward to this trip at the start. I was worried about being completely absent (no cell signal in the Canyon) for a week, as I was TAing for an online class at the time and also just being away from the Lab if anything was needed of me. However, after the pre-trip departure meeting, I began to get excited. Our trip consisted of 28 people in total, in two large inflatable motorized rafts. Conveniently, all 28 people were from my hometown, and one of my longest friends was also going on the trip. So, seeing lots of familiar faces and hearing about the fun that we are soon to have helped to shake off the anxiety of being away.\nAfter a 5am extremely nauseating bus ride (don’t ask, you don’t want to know), we were dropped off at Lee’s Ferry, where we were all to help load the boats with our personal gear as well as the supplies that we’ll all be using for the week, including a mind-boggling amount of beer (more on this later). We were met at Lee’s Ferry by my Uncle Denny and Aunt Karen, whom I haven’t seen in quite some time, but live out in Mesquite, NV. It was awesome to see them and catch up before we pushed off of the boat launch area. Also, at the water’s edge was a horse who’d come up for a drink of the cool river water. We don’t think it was wild, as it looked too well taken care of, but was a cool sight to see, and was definitely my dad’s way of saying goodbye and good luck to us before we floated down the river.\nThe first day of the trip was a bit rough, for me and for mom too. I had no doubts that I’d be fine with the living and sleeping conditions of the trip (cowboy camping under the stars sounded lovely to me) but was worried about my jetlag and how long it would take me to adjust to the drastic time change. I’d seen my boyfriend Ben be taken down by a weeks worth of jetlag from just an 8 hour time difference in Saudi, let alone the 18 hour difference I was facing. I kept falling asleep in the boat and was woken up abruptly to the chilly 45 degree water, and my mom was increasingly poking me and (in a way that only mothers could do) reminding me, not very gently, that if I were to beat the jetlag I have to force myself to stay awake. Once we got off the boat for our first camp of the trip, I perked up again, with the exciting opportunity to pick our camp and set up, and also to help unload the boats. This is where things got rough for mom. She is not much of an outdoorswoman, I have never in my 24 years of life taken a camping trip with her, and all of the skills I learned have come from my friends, boyfriend, and the backpacking class I took at IU (yes, really). She was pitching a fit (without pitching her own cot I might add) about these accommodations, to which I replied we are very lucky we have a cot to sleep on, people cooking all of our meals, and are most certainly not roughing it out here in the wilderness. Like the good daughter I am, I set up her bed for her and our little living arrangements. We shared an alcove of sand with my childhood friend Addison, his girlfriend, Mercedes, sister, Aly, and other friend, Austin (all of whom I was also friends with) and his mom, which was very cute. After this first night, and a bit of a wakeup call from myself I might add, mom got on much better with the camping, and my jetlag disappeared after the first night of 10 hours of sleep.\n\n  \n\nThe next few days tended to blend together, as red rocks transitioned from the Marble Canyon to the Grand Canyon Proper, we explored incredible hikes and sites along the side of the river, learned about the geology of the Grand Canyon and greater American Southwest. We also got many history lessons regarding the American presence in the Canyon, from the wild west up to present day. I was a bit disappointed in the relative lack of indigenous presence in many of the stories our guide told of the history of the Canyon. It was painted in the old and wore-out frame that these “native savages” were civilized by westward expansion and colonization, which was unpleasant to hear at best and racist and uninformed at worst. However, despite this, we still had a good time, and it seemed our other guide and swampers didn’t share this ideology.\nOne thing that I didn’t mention, and that I think is rather funny and telling of my small Indiana town, is that we had brought the most alcohol that our crew had ever seen for a trip! Enough that we were delayed by a half hour upon our original departure because the captains had to rearrange the boats to fit all of the beer, seltzers, and liquor we had brought. Before the trip had even started, Jeff, the organizer of the trip, had advised us to buy “double of what you are currently thinking you will drink on the trip.” Mom and I had thought “no way, it will be 110 degrees in the Canyon, I definitely don’t want to drink all day, that’ll be miserable” but alas, not wanting to be left out, we bought the recommended amount and I’m glad that we did, because I’ll be dammed if we didn’t drink every single can.  No longer was the crew worried about the space and weight of the beer, now they were worried about the space of the empty cans! After an evening talking with our crew, we asked them what they had thought about the amount of alcohol we’d brought. They had said that they thought for sure they would have to cut the trip short, because we would be too drunk and unruley, and wouldn’t listen to directions or would become a safety hazard. They said that they thought it was because we all knew each other, that we didn’t have a problem with calling out one another if someone was getting too drunk, or hadn’t drank enough water, which I thought was cool. Our little community of people from nowhere Syracuse, Indiana. It was awesome to bond with our captains and swampers, they were all wonderful people, and I am grateful for the opportunity to listen to their wisdom of this unique ecosystem they call home.\nUltimately, the trip came to an end, and I had found myself very sad to leave. From being stressed about taking off more time from school, to wanting to stay on the river for another week, this trip was so lovely, it bonded our group in a way that will stick with all of us forever, and I also was really happy to see people become one with nature while on this trip. I think that it’s easy to slip into this ecological disconnect, that human and nature are two separate entities, when in reality as an ecologist I know that’s not true. To be immersed in one of the seven natural wonders of the world, looking and touching the millennial old rock, I couldn’t help but feeling this intense respect for all of the life that came before me, and everything that is yet to come. It was with a deep gratitude that I thank the Grand Canyon for grounding me to that place and time, so I may remember the work that needs to be done to conserve these fragile ecosystems we call home.\n\nImage Gallery and map of our 8 day expedition down all 277 miles of the Colorado River:\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nImages were taken on my iPhone, my 35mm film camera, and my friend Addisons Canon EOS"
