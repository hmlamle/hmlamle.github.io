### Upbringing
<img src="images/aboutme1.jpg" alt="Childhood me wakeboarding" width="400" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px"/>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> I was born and raised in Northern Indiana, a product of <a href="https://www.travelindiana.com/kosciusko-county-the-land-of-lakes/">Land of Lakes County</a>. I only half jokingly say that lake water makes up my blood. Growing up, my family and I would spend every possible moment on our boat. I have fond memories of enjoying the water: from leisurely boat rides, dropping anchor and getting lost in a book, to water skiing, wakeboarding, and surfing. I even got my PADI open water certification in the lake! Each summer before high school (before sports practices started to dominate my schedule) I would also commandeer my families paddle boat to catch turtles, jar seaweed to ID on the family computer, and look for bluegill nests along the channel edge. Being so connected to the water from an early age undoubtedly shaped my career path in the natural sciences. </p>



### Hobbies 
<p style="font-size: 20px;">As previously mentioned, I grew up as an athlete as well as an amateur limnologist, and sports are still a large part of my life today. In addition to playing three sports in high school, I also was on my collegiate wakeboarding club team, which was such as cool experience and how I met some of my best friends at university. I'm a passionate fan of men's and women's basketball, always rooting on my Hoosiers, and love March Madness. I don't play a lot of basketball anymore, but do spend a lot of my free time playing tennis recreationally. It's a lot easier to do so here in South Florida, where there's never any snow! I also have recently been getting into running as a hobby, and completed my first half marathon in February of 2025. Looking forward to more races to come!</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Outside of school and being active, I don't have much time for anything else, but on occasion do like to partake in some creative hobbies as well. These include reading, making friendship bracelets, which I do just for fun and gift to people I love (I joke that if I give you one, your now branded by me) and also by journaling and scrapbooking. I never throw anything away, so scrapbooking is a great way to commemorate the useless things with sentimental value I've collected, like concert tickets, admission bracelets, boarding passes and fliers. It's a fun way to keep all of these things while not having them make a mess and clutter up my room.</p>

<H3>Scuba Diving</H3>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Of course, being a coral reef ecologist means that diving is a part of my job. But I still enjoy suiting up to go for recreational dives, and South Florida is a mecca for the diving industry in the US. I was first certified at 10 as a Junior Open Water Diver. I grew up watching my dad dive on our family vacations with my aunt and uncle, so I eagerly waited when I turned 10 so I could get certified too. I didn't get my second certification until I was at Indiana University. My advisor had introduced me to the Center for Underwater Science when I mentioned I wanted to focus in marine science, and enrolled in the advanced course. From then on I was hooked in the Center, continuing up to Dive Master as well as getting my scientific diving cert at IU, and became an instructor the Summer of 2022. Teaching diving was a difficult transition for me, quite frankly I was terrified at first of having people's lives in my hands, but realized that it is so rewarding. What made teaching so fulfilling to me was the couple of students whose eyes would light up and I knew that I'd opened a new world of possibilities for them. I don't teach diving anymore since I'm in grad school, but I do hope to find my way back into the recreational diving world.</p>
