# Welcome!
*My name is Hannah-Marie Lamle. Yes, Hannah-Marie is my full first name, don't let the hyphen fool you! I am an aspiring coral reef ecologist, currently earning my PhD at Florida International University. Broadly, I am interested in applying trait-based quantitative methods to understand coral community function and resilience. Outside of school, I love to dive recreationally, read, and run! Stay a while and explore more [about me](about.qmd), [my work](fiu.qmd), and [my travels](travel.qmd)!*
